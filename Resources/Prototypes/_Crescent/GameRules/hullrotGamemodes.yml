# GAME PRESETS ARE WHAT YOU VOTE ON AS A GAMEMODE.
# They do NOT CONTROL what spawns in by themselves. this is handled by the rule that it's pointing to in the rules: dictionary
# in hullrotGamemodes.yml you can find "Adventure" "VladzenaJackal", etc.

# GAMERULES ARE WAHT DECIDES WHAT SPAWNS IN, BY EVERYTHING IN THE ADVENTURERULE COMPONENT
#
# gameMapsByID is a DICTIONARY that describes all spawned grids defined by a gameMap.
# this is stuff like Port Vladzena, which has vladzena.yml (MAP) and vladzena.yml (PROTOTYPE)
# you can give the dictionary key whatever name you want
# gameMapID must equal the ID of the gameMap prototype's YML.
# posX & posY define the position it will be spawned at
# randomOffsetX & randomOffsetY describe an offset that will be applied to the position. leave undefined or at 0 to spawn as is. This offset is ALWAYS POSITIVE.
# IFFColor changes what color the IFF in the shuttle and map screen will have. Use colors from the Color type, like White, Aqua, Blue, etc.
# IFFFaction sets the faction of the object. to be honest i dont know if this does anything.
# hideIFF is a boolean that controls if the object is visible from the map screen or not. by default it is set to false. use this for derelicts or secrets
